# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# dont' froget to destroy_all
# start with the ones that belogns_to and only afterwards add has_many to avoid multiplications in database
 
# "ClassName.reset_pk_sequence" allows you to start fresh ids whenever you run rails db:seed
